# OpenAI API Quickstart - Python example app

This is an example pet name generator app used in the OpenAI API [quickstart tutorial](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart). It uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) web framework. Check out the tutorial or follow the instructions below to get set up.

## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Python installed, [install it from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). It is important to note that downloading the incorrect version of Python may result in dependency conflicts. It is recommended to use [version 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/), which is the most widely used version, to avoid such conflicts.

2. Clone this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   $ cd openai-quickstart-python
   ```

4. Create a new virtual environment

   ```bash
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

5. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

7. Add your [API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file

8. Run the app

   ```bash
   $ flask run
   ```

You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)! For the full context behind this example app, check out the [tutorial](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart).
