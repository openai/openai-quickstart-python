0,Summarize Maxwell's equations in 100 words.,"A set of coupled partial differential equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, classical optics, and electric circuits",Compare the following answer of the question above to the correct answer:,more and again,0.6,gpt-3.5-turbo,"The answer ""more and again"" does not provide any relevant information about Maxwell's equations and does not compare to the correct answer.",99,26
1,Summarize Maxwell's equations in 100 words.,"A set of coupled partial differential equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, classical optics, and electric circuits",Compare the following answer of the question above to the correct answer:,with feeling,0.6,gpt-3.5-turbo,"I'm sorry, but the answer ""with feeling"" does not provide a valid response to the question of summarizing Maxwell's equations. The correct answer requires a factual and concise summary of the equations, without any emotional context.",98,45
2,Summarize Maxwell's equations in 100 words.,"A set of coupled partial differential equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, classical optics, and electric circuits",Compare the following answer of the question above to the correct answer:,A set of equations that summarize the behavior and relationship between the change in the electric and magnetic fields over time.,0.5,gpt-3.5-turbo,"The answer ""A set of equations that summarize the behavior and relationship between the change in the electric and magnetic fields over time"" is a brief summary of Maxwell's equations, but it does not fully explain the significance and applications of the equations. The correct answer provides more detail about the equations' role in classical electromagnetism, optics, and electric circuits, and it mentions the Lorentz force law. Therefore, the correct answer is more thorough and accurate.",118,92
